# Machine-Learning-Projects
**By Noah Knijff**  

This repository contains a collection of some of my own Machine Learning projects and some ML assignments from my Master's at the University of Amsterdam in Computational Science.

- **Description:** This section contains projects on data cleaning, clustering, and classification. The notebooks demonstrate techniques for handling class room google-form submitted datasets and extracting useful insights.
- **Notebooks:**
  - DMT_Group_157_Assignment_1.ipynb – A group project on data mining techniques, including preprocessing and analysis of a class room google-form submitted dataset.

  - exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb – A project in which I perform exploratory data analysis, and cleaning based on a dataset, containing a synthetic representation of space missions

  - regression.ipynb – A project in which I perform exploratory data analysis, and cleaning based on a dataset, containing a synthetic representation of space missions
